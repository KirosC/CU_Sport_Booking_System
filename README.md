## Background
A software engineering course project. We discover that booking a sports facility in CUHK may be very confusing. Therefore, few students studying in CUHK join together to make this project possible. We hope to make the procedure of booking a sports facility easy and fun at the same time. We also hope to incentive students to do more exercise and find ways to give coaches opportunities to earn money and teach students. So we come up with this website, hoping students and coaches would like it!
